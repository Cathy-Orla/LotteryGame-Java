# LotteryGame-Java
Lottery feature game where a user has the option of playing up to three lines, each six numbers long. 
We use 2-Dimensional arrays to store the number of lines and the values entered by user. 
This is then compared with the 1-Dimensional array containing random generated numbers from the random java class with the processLinesPlayed method which then goes on to display the correctly guessed numbers to the user and storing the history of said games.
